# Melanoma_Detection_Using_CNN


The objective of this project:
Build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

Problem Statement  :
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly 
if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about 
the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International 
Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets 
were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

Steps Involved in the entire prjoects:
 - Data Understanding
 - Dataset Creation
 - Dataset visualisation
 - Model Building & training 
 - Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 
 - Model Building & training on the augmented data
 - Class distribution
 - Handling class imbalances
 - Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
